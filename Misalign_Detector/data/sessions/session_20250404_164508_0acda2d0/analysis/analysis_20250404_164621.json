  "cause": "The participant expressing 'This is very time consuming' suggests a lack of understanding of the request to help. They are acknowledging a problem but not grasping the specific action being taken. The initial statement implies a need for assistance, but the lack of detail suggests a potential misunderstanding of what's being asked.",
  "recommendation": "Ask for clarification. Instead of simply stating 'I don't know what to do,' the participant should ask a specific question like, 'Could you tell me what you need help with?' or 'What's the goal of this task?'",
