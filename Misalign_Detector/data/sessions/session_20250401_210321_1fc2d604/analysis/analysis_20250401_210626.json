  "cause": "The conversation is highly fragmented and lacks a clear, logical progression. There\u2019s a sudden shift in topic \u2013 from a seemingly normal discussion to a panicked, rambling state. The lack of context and a consistent narrative creates a significant disconnect between the participants.",
  "recommendation": "Initiate a structured conversation. Begin with a brief recap of the previous discussion and then gently steer the conversation back to a focused topic. Acknowledge the user's distress and offer reassurance. Perhaps a simple, 'I understand you're feeling stressed. Let's try to refocus on the original goal of this meeting.'",

This is not a meeting because I spent the night like this. Yeah. And we were like, how are you going to spend the night like this? Yeah, I was... I agree. I agree. Brace yourself.
