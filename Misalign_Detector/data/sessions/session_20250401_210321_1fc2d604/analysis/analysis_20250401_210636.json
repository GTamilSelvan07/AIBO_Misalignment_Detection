The user's responses are often hesitant and confused, indicating a potential lack of understanding of the task or the context.",
  "recommendation": "The conversation needs to be restructured. Start with a clear, concise explanation of the task. Ask the user to provide a brief overview of their current situation. Offer support and reassurance to alleviate the user's anxiety. Break down the task into smaller, manageable steps. Consider using a more direct and reassuring tone to reduce the user's confusion.",
