  "recommendation": "To resolve this, the speaker should explicitly state the goal of the conversation and provide more context. Perhaps a brief recap of the previous exchange would be helpful.  A simple, 'Let's start again,' or 'I want to understand what you're trying to say' would be beneficial.",

The misalignment score is really low. How can I make it very in interest, increasing? I can finally understand this stuff, so don't worry about this. I'm opening the beer.
